### Bird Entanglement

![Annual number of seabird carcasses reported as entangled in monthly Beach COMBER surveys from 1997-2012. The survey study area began with ten beaches (1997-1998), expanded to 11 beaches (1999), then to 17 beaches, including surveys in San Luis Obispo County (mid-2001-2002), and grew to 30 beaches by 2009 to the present. Note: The survey area has increased over time. The numbers reported are for total number of observation each year and have not been standardized by survey effort. Therefore, this data should not be used to examine trends in entanglement rates over time.

### Whale Entanglement

![**Figure App.C.4.10.** Annual number of large whale entanglements reported (blue) and confirmed (red) along the U.S. West Coast.
 Reports of entanglements have increased in recent years. Factors contributing to this trend likely include an increasing overlap of
 whale activities (e.g., migrating, feeding) with human activities that have the potential to entangle whales (e.g., fishing, buoy
 installation) and an increase in on-the-water observers likely to report entangled individuals (e.g., whale watching, recreational boating). Confirmed entanglements from 2000 to 2015 of gray and humpback whales include 11 from Santa Barbara and two from Ventura counties. Figure: D.

### Ship Traffic

![**Figure App.C.4.12.** Traffic patterns of large commercial vessels (cargo and tanker vessels) in the Santa Barbara Channel region for
2008, 2010, and 2014. The number of commercial ship transits is shown, using Automatic Identification System (AIS) data
transmitted from ships. Vessels transiting to and from the Ports of Los Angeles/Long Beach that pass by the northern Channel
Islands use either the Santa Barbara Channel Traffic Separation Scheme around the north side of the islands, or take routes south
of the islands. Data source: USCG AIS data, processed by NMFS; Figure: MSWGSS 2016](../img/cinms_cr/App.C.4.12.MSWGSS_2016.jpg)

### Ambient Noise

![**Figure App.C.4.13.** Ambient noise levels in the Santa Barbara Channel represented as monthly averages for 40 Hz (red) and 90 Hz (blue) bands. The decline in ambient noise levels observed between 2007 and 2010 reflects decreased regional shipping activity during that time. While ambient noise has increased since 2010, it has not returned to the higher levels observed in 2007 to 2008. Data sources: McKenna et al. 2012, J. Hildebrand/ UCSD unpub. data; Figure: J.

### Marine Debris

![**Figure App.C.4.14.** Marine debris estimates modeled along the mainland southern California coast based on debris measured by the National Marine Debris Monitoring Program. Marine debris was relatively constant across the last five years of this time series (1999-2007) and within historic levels. Data source: Ribic et al. 2012; Figure: K. Andrews/NOAA](../img/cinms_cr/App.C.4.14.Marine debris_CCIEA.jpg)

![**Figure App.C.4.15.** Variation over time in percentage of stations from winter CalCOFI cruises with plastic micro-debris. Micro-debris was present in more than 50 percent of samples at each time period. Figure: Gilfillan et al. 2009](../img/cinms_cr/App.C.4.15.Gilfillan_graph.png)

![**Figure App.C.4.16.** Spatial distribution, concentration, and characteristics of plastic micro-debris in net samples from the CalCOFI region from winter cruises in (A) 1984, (B) 1994, and (C) 2007. Open circles indicate no plastic debris detected and filled circle diameter are proportional to particle concentrations (number per cubic meter). There was no relationship between the numerical concentration of particles and distance from shore, the presumed source of the majority of debris.

### Oil & Gas

![**Figure App.C.4.17.** The status and trends of offshore oil and gas activity in southern California was measured using a normalized index of oil and gas production from offshore wells in state and federal waters in California. Activity has been stable over the last five years, but the short-term average was well below the long-term average (dashed green line). A rather steady decrease in oil and gas production has occurred since the mid-1990s.
